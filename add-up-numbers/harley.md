```js
const addUpNumber = (num) => {
return (num *(num + 1)) / 2
};
```

## Strategy

I approached this problem mathematically. Rather than selecting from a list of
possible answers, I created a function to calculate the correct value from the
argument.

## Implementation

- The `addUpNumber` function is a utility that calculates the sum of all natural numbers from `1` up to the given input number `num`. It uses a mathematical formula for summing a sequence, ensuring optimal performance and simplicity.

**Arrow function - implicit return**: The solution is not a single expression
so I  need a `return` statement.

## possible refractors

- **Input Validation:** I Added checks to ensure `num` is a positive integer.
- **Helper Function:** I Extracted the summation formula into a reusable utility.
- **Named Function:** I Converted the arrow function to a named function for debugging.
- **Enhanced Error Messaging:** I Improved error messages for clarity.

## Refrences

Time Complexity: The function demonstrates constant time complexity (O(1)), meaning it does not rely on iteration or recursion. For more on time complexity:
